How to install.
Go to folder of your your chosen device and download the release. Among the release files shall be a folder containing instructions of what to do on some specific devices.
If there is no such file then make sure you install a custom recovery and then flash it just like a regular rom.
************************************************************************************************************************************************************
I am not responsible for anything that happens to your device. That is on you and fo the love of God, please check your Samsung model number and please make sure it matches with the one of the release i have put out. I dont want someone to have troubles with their device when they have flashed the wrong rom.
